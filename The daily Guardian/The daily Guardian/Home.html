<h2>Weekly news</h2>

<p>
    So starting next season Bungie will be adding a raid rotation every weekly reset this will make raids that are no
    longer played a featured activity that will get you better rewards the same will done for the dungions.
    Fixed an issue that could cause teams to incorrectly wipe during a Master Wellspring when an objective is completed
    with only a few seconds left on the timer.
    Added a failsafe so that carriable objects in both the ritual and boss phases of a Wellspring won’t spawn out of
    bounds. Fixed an issue where players could not complete the Evidence Board Quest Report: ALTAR-REFLECT due to Altar
    of Reflection not showing up properly.
    More like Altar of Re-Appearance. Fixed an issue where Rhulk would suddenly become shy and no longer transition back
    to his initial phase properly, effectively blocking progress.
    Fixed an issue where the Caretaker’s dynamic health threshold UI would not consistently display for all players.
