<h3>New weapons</h3>

<p>

    With the release of the Witch Queen Bungie has added over 40 new weapons with brand new perks that can make your
    builds even greater than they have been before.
    Psychohack is a new Origin Trait in Destiny 2 with the release of The Witch Queen expansion that comes with all
    weapons acquired from Savathun's Throne World. Sustained damage from the weapon lowers the target's damage output
    for a short duration. Origin Traits in general are a column added with the release of this expansion.

    Much like the Intrinsic Traits that exotics in Destiny 2 have, Origin Traits serve as a way to identify the origin
    and identity of weapon manufacturers. Each of the Year Five weapons will include an Origin Trait. For example, all
    Veist weapons will now drop with the Veist Stinger Origin Trait.
    By adding a new column with a bevy of different options depending on the weapon's origin, Bungie has manufactured a
    reason to farm not only new weapons for an extra perk but the craftable version of that particular weapon. With
    weapon crafting having been implemented, god rolls are far more attainable and player agency is once again a thing.
